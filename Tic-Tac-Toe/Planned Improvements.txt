Planned Improvements:
- Document the code
- Areas for improvement:
#1 The gameValid method could be optimized. Currently, it checks each winning condition (row, column, diagonal) separately for “X” and “0”. You could refactor this to avoid repetition.

#2 The Scanner object is created in each round of the game. It would be more efficient to create it once outside of the loop and reuse it.

#3 The game doesn’t handle invalid inputs. If a player enters a number that’s already been marked or a number outside the range 1-9, the game will overwrite the existing mark or throw an error.

#4 The game doesn’t announce the winner. When the game ends, it simply prints “Game Over!” without indicating who won or if it was a draw.
